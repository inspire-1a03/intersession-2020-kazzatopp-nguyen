## Day 1: Reflection
<!--
In this section, provide a ~250 word reflection on your first day of the module, and discuss why you're interested in this module and what you hope to take away from it.

Hello World!

Ever since I began university, I kept hearing the words like "coding" and "Python", but I had no idea what they meant. This prompted me to enroll in a free Introduction to Computer Science course on the Harvard Online website. I never kept up with the work and things got in the way. Starting this course today, I finally feel like I am getting the introduction to computer science that I was looking for. Most of the people in the class are also beginning from scratch and the class runs at a pace that I am comfortable with. 

The first day with Markdown was a good introduction because it was simple and easy to follow. Even after one day, I feel as if I am a little bit “in the know” because I can program Github Pages to italicize the words I want italicized. I am really looking forward to working with the package I received of random circuits because it looks like a bunch of random stuff. I am excited that by the end of the week I am going to actually understand what each piece is, what it does, and how I can use them to make something. I am excited to start day 2!

You're also asked to insert a photo that represents your accomplishments on your first day. 
- Take a photo of you working or one of your circuits and upload it to the /docs/images/ folder of this repository. 
- Then, insert your photo into your document by modifying the markdown example that has been inserted below.

<!--
Inserting an image takes the form: 
![image alt text](url/to/photo "Logo Title Text")

## Day 2: Results
<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from your final Day 2 build task--a thermometer connected to an RDB LED--into your GitHub repository.
Provide a short (~150 words) summary of your work on this circuit:
- How does your device work?
- What was challenging? 
- What worked? What didn't? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
-->

## Arduino build-off results
<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from the final product of your Arduino build-off into the top-level of your module GitHub repository.
In ~300 words, provide a final device description and product pitch: 
- What does it do? Use a table (created in markdown) to list and describe the features. You can use the template provided below. 
- Describe briefly how it works.
- How could it be used in everyday life (or maybe just in rare cases)? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
- Include a snippet of code using the ``` ``` characters to display the code properly. 
Finally, record a short (30 second) video of a 'product pitch' for your device. 
- Upload the video to Youtube, and use the sample code below to embed your video.

<!--
Below is an example of embedding a YouTube video in a markdown document for use in GitHub pages. 
Note that this video won't show when previewing the document in GitHub--it only works on the GitHub pages webpage. 
- Once your YouTube video is uploaded, right click and select ```<> Copy embed code```. 
- You can paste this code directly into your markdown document. 
- Note that you may want to adjust the width and height parameters to make it fit well in your webpage
